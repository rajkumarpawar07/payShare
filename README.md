# PayShare - A Split Billing and Payment Tracking App
PayShare is an innovative Android application designed to simplify the process of sharing expenses among friends, family, or roommates. Developed using Kotlin (considering its modern syntax and interoperability with Java), and integrating with Firebase for real-time database management, authentication, and cloud functions, PayShare aims to offer a seamless user experience for tracking, splitting, and settling shared expenses in various scenarios like dining out, group travel, household bills, or event planning.


## Technologies to Use:
JAVA and Kotlin for application development, to leverage its concise syntax and safety features.
Firebase Realtime Database for storing transaction data and changes in expenses.
Firebase Authentication for managing user identities and profiles.
Cloud Functions to handle backend logic securely, like calculating splits and sending notifications.
Material Design Components for a modern, intuitive UI/UX design.
Google Pay API (or similar) for integrating payment functionalities, allowing users to settle their shares directly within the app.

## Features to Implement:
Expense Tracking: Users can log expenses, categorize them, and attach receipts.
